## Word counts

With the [given template](https://aut.utcluj.ro/files/licente-disertatii/2023/Anexa2_Model_lucrare_diploma.docx), I seem to be getting around 550 (ro) - 580 (en) words per page with Wikipedia content. For a "worst"-case scenario, let's round that up to 600 words/page.

Aiming for 50 total pages (spec says 40-60), of which let's say 10 would be figures and math, I'd need 24000 words. And we can round that up to 25k.

[Guidelines](https://aut.utcluj.ro/files/licente-disertatii/2023/Regulament_finalizare_AUT_2023.pdf) specify the following sizes for each section
- intro: 5% = 1250 words
- background: <30% = <7500 words
- my actual stuff: >60% = >15000 words
- conclusion: 5% = 1250 words

Of course, these aren't rigid values, I just wrote them down to get a slightly better idea of the scale.

## Figures

I want to use figures as a means to capture the jury's attention only where it will have impact. No figures if they draw attention to a part of the thesis that isn't amazing. TODO figure out which parts are relevant:
