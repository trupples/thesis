# Strategy

While this might be a little superficial, I'll try to set out some measurable objectives to make sure I don't get tunnel vision.

## Objectives

### Respect imposed requirements

TODO - I don't know them yet

### Draw the jury's eye towards the good parts

- [ ] Use figures as points of attention with surgical precision. Maybe one per key idea, worst case 20 figures overall?
